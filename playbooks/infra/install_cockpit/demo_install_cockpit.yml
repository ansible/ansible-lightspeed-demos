        # # 3a. Press "ENTER" at the end of the multi-task prompt line
        # #     First task note - Ansible Lightspeed used the generic "Restart and enable service" prompt
        # #            and full Playbook context to infer the recommendation should restart the "cockpit" service.
        # #     Second task note -Ansible Lightspeed used the generic language prompt and Playbook context
        # #            and used the correct default Cockpit service port (9090) in the suggestion.

    # Restart and enable service & wait 15 seconds for it to be available
